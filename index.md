Syllabus:

## Course Description: 
Continuous and discrete-time transform analysis techniques with illustrative applications. Linear and time-invariant systems, transfer functions. Fourier series,
Fourier transform, Laplace and Z-transforms. Sampling and reconstruction. Solution of 
differential and difference equations using transforms. Frequency response, Bode plots,
stability analysis. Illustrated by analysis of communication systems and feedback 
control systems.

## Course Outline: 
* Linear time-invariant systems, Fourier transforms, and applications to signal processing
* Sampling of continuous-time signals, upsampling and downsampling of discrete-time signals
* System analysis using Laplace and z-Transforms
* Using transform techniques to design feedback control systems
* Sample engineering application:  guidance and navigation of autonomous systems
