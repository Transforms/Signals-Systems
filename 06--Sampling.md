## Introduction: 
Under certain conditions, a continuous-time signal can be completely represented by and recovered from knowledge of its value, or samples, at points equally spaced in time. This property follows from a basic result that is referred to as the sampling theorem. In this chapter, we will study the concept of sampling and the process of reconstructing a continous-time siganl from its samples. Certainly there will be some limitatino in completely recovering the continous-time signals from its samples. What are some necessary conditions for the success of this recovery?
