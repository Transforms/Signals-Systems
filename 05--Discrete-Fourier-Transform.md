## Introduction: 
In this chapter we are going to learn about the Discrete Fourier Transform, which is another representation applicable to a finite duration discrete sequence such that the sequence is zero outsite the duration. There are certainly connections between the Discrete Fourier Series (DFT) and the Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT); however, don't mess them up!
