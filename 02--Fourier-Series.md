## Introduction: 
In this chapter, we focus on the Fourier Series for continuous-time and discrete-time periodic signals. We will see how the response of an LTI system to a complex exponential also has a particular simple form, which then provides us with another convenient way to analyze the LTI system and its properties. Later we will extend the analysis to the Fourier transform of the broad classes of aperiodic, finite energy signals.
