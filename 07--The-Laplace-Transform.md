## Introduction: 
In the preceding chapters, we have seen that the continous-time Fourier Transform provides us with a representation for signals as linear combination of complex exponentials of the form exp(st) with s = jw. However, s can be an arbitrary value, not just limited to be purely imaginary. This observation leards to a more generalized continous-time Fourier transform, which is also known as the Laplace Transform.
