## Introduction: 

In last chapter we developed a representation of periodic signals as linear combinations of complex exponentials. In this current chapter we will extend these concepts to apply to aperiod signals. We will come to see how this large class of signals, including all signals with finite energy, can also be represented through a linear combination of complex exponentials.
