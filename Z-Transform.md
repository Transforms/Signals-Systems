## Summary: 
In Chapter 9, we developed the Laplace Transform as an extension of the continuous-time Fourier transform. In this chapter, we will be using the similar approach for discrete time as we develop the z-transform, which is the discrete-time counterpart of the Laplace transform. However, be prepared for some important distinctions between the z-tranforms and the Laplace transform that arise from the fundamental differences between the continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems.

## Lectures

* 175g plain flour
* 90g brown sugar
* 50g unsalted butter, diced, at room temperature
* 2 tbsp golden syrup
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1 tsp ground ginger
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
* Icing sugar to dust

## Method

1. Sift the flour, ginger, cinnamon and bicarbonate of soda into a large mixing bowl.
2. Use your fingers to rub in the diced butter. Mix in the sugar.
3. Mix the egg with the syrup then pour into the flour mixture. Fold in well to form a dough.
4. Tip some flour onto the work surface and knead the dough until smooth.
5. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
6. Roll the dough out flat and use a shaped cutter to make as many cookies as you like.
7. Transfer the cookies to a tray and bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Lightly dust the cookies with icing sugar.
