## Introduction: 
In Chapter 7, we developed the Laplace Transform as an extension of the continuous-time Fourier transform. In this chapter, we will be using the similar approach for discrete time as we develop the z-transform, which is the discrete-time counterpart of the Laplace transform. However, be prepared for some important distinctions between the z-tranforms and the Laplace transform that arise from the fundamental differences between the continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems.
