## Introduction: 
There are a number of basic system properties. Two of these, linearity and time-invaraince, play a fundamental role in signal and system analysis. In this chapter, we will develop an understanding of these properties by deriving and examining a fundamental and extremely useful representationf for LTI systems and by introducting an important class of these systems.
