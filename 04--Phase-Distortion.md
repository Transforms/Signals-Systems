## Introduction: 
In the last chapterS we developed epresentations of both periodic and aperiodic one-dimensional signals as referrd to Fourier Seires for periodic signals and Fourier transform for aperiodic signals. In this current chapter we will extend these concepts to apply to two dimensional signals. 
We will also introduce the phase distortion in LTI systems and the linear phase systems.
